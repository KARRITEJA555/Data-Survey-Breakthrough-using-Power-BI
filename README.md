# Data Professionals Survey Analysis (Power BI)

## Overview
This project analyzes survey data from data professionals using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to clean, transform, and visualize the dataset to uncover insights about programming preferences, salaries, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Transformation (Power Query Editor)**
   - Removed unwanted and empty columns.  
   - Changed column data types for consistency.  
   - Created a new calculated column (average) using two columns.  

2. **Data Understanding**
   - Explored key attributes such as age, salary, job title, country, and programming preferences.  
   - Prepared data for meaningful visualization.  

3. **Power BI Visualizations**
   - **Heat Map**: Distribution of survey takers by country.  
   - **Bar Chart Slicer**: Favorite programming languages.  
   - **Bar Chart**: Average salary by job title.  
   - **Pie Chart**: Difficulty level in breaking into data careers.  
   - **Gauges**:  
     - Happiness with salary  
     - Happiness with work-life balance  
   - **Cards**:  
     - Total number of survey takers  
     - Average age of survey takers  

## Key Insights
- Popular programming languages vary significantly across roles.  
- Average salaries differ widely by job title.  
- Many professionals face challenges breaking into data-related fields.  
- Work-life balance satisfaction is relatively higher compared to salary satisfaction.
